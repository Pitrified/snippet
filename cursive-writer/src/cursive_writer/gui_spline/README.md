# Spline drawing GUI

### TODO

* Make scrollable the point frame list
* Button in FrameSPoint to delete that point
* When hovering a FrameSPoint, turn the correspondent arrow a different color
* When clicking a FrameSPoint, set that as selectedSP
* File dialog to save glyphs
* Rescale from abs (image) to normalized (FM coord)


### Ideas

* Each spline point has unique ID, the splines are list of IDs
