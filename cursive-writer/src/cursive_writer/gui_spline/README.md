# Spline drawing GUI

### TODO

* When hovering a FrameSPoint, turn the correspondent arrow a different color
* When clicking a FrameSPoint, set that as selectedSP
* File dialog to save glyphs
* Rescale from abs (image) to normalized (FM coord)
* Button to delete FSP
* Button in FrameSPoint to delete that point
* After deleting a point set as selected the previous one, handle the first in some way
* Move spline buttons and info to left sidebar
* Add buttons to change selected SP, left, very left, orientation
* Add loading of a glyph, after FMlines are set, remap those points to the current image
* If deleting when a header is selected, merge the two glyphs before/after that

##### Done

* Make scrollable the point frame list

### Ideas

* Each spline point has unique ID, the splines are list of IDs
