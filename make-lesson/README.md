# Basic Makefile

Basic makefile, made following [this guide](https://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/).

### Makefile recap
* Use `#` for comments in Makefiles
* Write rules as `target : dependencies`
* Specify update actions in a tab-indented block under the rule
* Use `.PHONY` to mark targets that *donâ€™t* correspond to files
* `$@` means 'the target of the current rule'
* `$^` means 'all the dependencies of the current rule'
* `$<` means 'the first dependency of the current rule'
* `%` is a Make wildcard
* `$*` is a special variable which gets replaced by the stem with which the rule matched
* `$(...)` is a variable reference
* use `include` to load files
* `wildcard` returns the list of files that matches a pattern
* `patsubst` takes a pattern, a replacement string and a list of names
* `@` before a command suppresses printing
* `@sed -n 's/^##//p' $<` prints docstring starting with `##`
* `.PHONY : all` as first command
* `$(name:string1=string2)` For each word in 'name' replace 'string1' with 'string2'
