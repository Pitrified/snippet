### Agent

Let an agent walk on a map, change direction randomly with slight bias to one side.

### Grow tree

Put a short (wobbly) segment, then attach another.

Possibly put the new segment between the old ones.

### Connect tree

Put dots in the plane, connect to closest until all are linked, starting from center.

Use dilation to obtain the wobbly look from the tree.

##### Split tree

Once you have the tree, check if some segments are too long and split them.

Maybe add a third there.
